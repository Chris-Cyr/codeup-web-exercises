    <p>HTML Elements
        HTML uses elements to describe the data in a web document. These elements help give meaning and context to information being displayed. With the exception of void elements (see below), all elements begin with an opening tag that is the name of the element inside of angle brackets (< and >) and end with a closing tag, which is the name of the element preceded by a /, also inside of angle brackets.

        For example, here is a paragraph element:


    <p>
        content
    </p>
    In between the opening and closing tag is the contents of the element. This can be either text, or additional html elements.

    When an element contains other elements, we say that the surrounding element is the parent element, and the nested elements are the child elements.


    <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
    In the above example, the h1 element is a child of the body element, and the h1's parent element is the body element. The contents of the h1 element is the text "Hello, World!", and the contents of the body element is the h1 element.

    Block-Level and Inline Elements
    A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block." They also begin on new lines. Generally, block-level elements contain data, other block-level elements, or inline elements.


    <div>
        content
    </div></p>

</body>
